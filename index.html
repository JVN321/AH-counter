            "Greetings Mr./Madam Toastmaster, fellow Toastmasters, and guests.
            The purpose of the Ah-Counter is to note words and sounds that are
            used as a "crutch" or "pause filler" by anyone who speaks. During
            the meeting, I will listen for overused words, including and, well,
            but, so, and you know. I will also listen for filler sounds,
            including ah, um, and er. I will also note when a speaker repeats a
            word or phrase, such as "I, I" or "This means, this means." At the
            end of the meeting, I will report the number of times that each
            speaker used these expressions.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you, Mr./Madam Toastmaster."</p>
